# Installation

Tactician is available on Packagist.

**_Note: Currently, Tactician is pre-alpha state, so you'll need to add it to composer.json with dev-master by hand. Once we've tagged an 0.1 release, follow the instructions below instead._**

To install, just run:

	> composer require league/tactician

Just leave the version blank and Composer will automatically find the latest version for your project and install it. 

Now we need to configure Tactician for your project.

## Setup
There are a few different ways to configure Tactician, depending on your Framework.

- [None](#no-framework)
- [Symfony2](#symfony2)
- [Zend Framework 2](#zend-framework-2)
- [Laravel](#laravel)

## No Framework

If you just want to get started and don't care about tweaking anything, you can use our DefaultSetup factory to get running with a minimum of fuss.

~~~ php

// TODO: DefaultSetup factory

~~~

That said, if you'd like to change the handler method called or any other options, take a look at the [Tweaking Tactician](/tweaking-tactician) page for more details. It's really easy. Promise.
