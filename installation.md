# Installation

Tactician is available on Packagist.

**_Note: Currently, Tactician is pre-alpha state, so you'll need to add it to composer.json with dev-master by hand. Once we've tagged an 0.1 release, follow the instructions below instead._**

To install, just run:

	> composer require league/tactician

Just leave the version blank and Composer will automatically find the latest version for your project and install it. 

Now we need to configure Tactician for your project.

## Framework
There are a few different ways to configure Tactician, depending on your Framework.

- [None](#no-framework)
- [Symfony2](#symfony2)
- [Zend Framework 2](#zend-framework-2)
- [Laravel](#laravel)

## No Framework

Tactician is really customizable, so there's lots of things you can tweak. If you don't care and just want to get started, you can use our DefaultSetup factory that gets you running with a minimum of fuss.

~~~ php

// TODO: DefaultSetup factory

~~~
  
If you'd like to change the method name called or any other options, take a look at the [Tweaking Tactician](/tweaking-tactician) page for more details. It's really easy.
